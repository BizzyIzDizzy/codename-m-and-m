You can use this script to build the entire project alltogether
or you can use it to do all the sections of the building seperatly!

Usage:
./make.sh [flag] [file1 ... fileN]

Usable flags are:

-assemble     - will assemble the files provided with the [file1 ... fileN]
		argument or the files in the NASMSRC variable in this script 
		(can be modified) if no files are provided.

-compile      - will compile .c and .cpp files provided with the [fileq ... fileN]
		argument or the files in the CSRC and CPPSRC variable in this 
		script (can be modified) if no files are provided.

-link         - will link all the object files together into a kernel binary.
		The [file1 ... fileN] argument must be provided so the linker 
		knows which files to link together! This can not be done 
		automaticly so u MUST provide the filenames!

-clean        - will remove all the object files and the kernel binaries!

-run          - will run the kernel binary in the QEMU system simulator!

-all          - will assemble, compile and link all the files in the src and 
		asm folder of this project. All the source files included 
		in the project must be entered in the variables in this script!
		Varriables:
			NASMSRC - all the assembly sources seperated spaces!
			CSRC - all the C sources seperated with spaces!
			CPPSRC - all the C++ sources seperated with spaces
		If you will use diffferend Linker script file you should enter 
		that aswell:
			LDSCRIPT - linker script file - it should be only one!
		Then it should run the kernel binary with QEMU
		This will also clean all the object files in the object folder.
		The kernel binary should be in the kernel folder.

-help	       - will print out this help message.
